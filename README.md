# How I Cloned and set up the project.
First of all , Prerequisites
I made sure  Git was  installed on my machine.I created a github account.
I forked the main repository which has the name Daquiver1/ID_DCIT205_IA and replaced the ID with my actual ID. 
Secondly, I cloned it and copied the URL. I then went to my desktop and created an empty folder and named it Web dev.
I then opened the command prompt in the folder and  i typed the following  codes
git clone and added the URL I copied from the main repository. I  checked the current state of my repo by using the git status command. I ended the clone process on the command prompt with Code . and opened the Vs code . In the Vscode i typed some number of codes ,commit it using the git commit command and finally push the changes to the main repository and this process continued about every change and addition in my projects.
